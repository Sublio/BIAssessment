API Testing Approach

1.  Varios testing types
    Functional Testing: Ensure the API performs as expected. This includes testing endpoints with valid and invalid inputs (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests).
    Performance Testing: Check how the API handles a large volume of requests or data.
    Security Testing: Verify the API is protected from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities (e.g., authentication, data encryption).
    Error Handling: Ensure the API returns appropriate error messages and status codes (e.g., 404, 500).

2.  Exploratory Testing Scenarios
    Boundary Testing: Test edge cases like maximum and minimum values for inputs.
    Invalid Inputs: Send malformed or missing parameters to see how the API reacts.
    Unauthorized Access: Try accessing data without proper authentication.
    Rate Limiting: Send multiple requests in quick succession to test for rate limiting.
    Versioning: Check if older versions of the API still work and if deprecated features are properly flagged.

3. Integrations:
    CI/CD Integration
    Simple atomised test cases.
    No dependable test scenarios
